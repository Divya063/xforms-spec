The ODK XForm specification is a subset of the far larger [XForm 1.0 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/). It contains a few additional features not found in the XForm specification. 

The ODK XForm Specification continues to evolve. In this document you will find various references to "JavaRosa" and "OpenRosa". OpenRosa was the name of the [initial specification](https://bitbucket.org/javarosa/javarosa/wiki/xform) that formed the basis of the ODK specification. JavaRosa is the name of a Java library that implements the OpenRosa specification. ODK, JavaRosa, OpenRosa are still often used to refer to the same, but we recommend using this document to build tools that are compliant with the ODK Ecosystem.

The document assumes at least a fair understanding of XML and XPath. It is also useful to refer to [XForms 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xforms-20031014/) for details about shared features.
